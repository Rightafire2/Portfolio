This is the source code for my portfolio website. In this README, I will outline how to run the website locally.

## Installation

To start, either clone the repository (if accessing from GitHub) or download the compressed file and unzip the file. Make sure you have node installed as it is required for launching this project. Next, in your terminal navigate to the "final" folder and run the following command:

```
npm i
```

Running this command will install the necessary node modules required to run the project.

## Locally Running the code

After installing the node_modules, run the following command to run the code locally:

```
npm start
```

This should launch the code locally in your browser.

NOTE: In the recording, I noticed a 404 error when the links on the portfolio readmes are clicked when javascript is disabled. I have fixed the error in this code and it now launches the readmes properly.
