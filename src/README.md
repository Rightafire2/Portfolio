This is the source code for my portfolio website. In this README, I will outline how to run the website locally.

## Installation

To start, either clone the repository or download the compressed file and unzip the file. Next, in your terminal navigate to the "final" folder and run the following command:

```
npm i
```

Running this command will install the necessary node modules required to run the project.

## Locally Running the code

After installing the node_modules, run the following command to run the code locally:

```
npm start
```

This should launch the code locally in your browser.
