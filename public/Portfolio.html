    <h3>Ulcerative Colitis Website</h3>
    <p>This website outlines my journey along with tricks that were helpful for me in recovery from Ulcerative Colitis.
      It is meant to serve as a useful tool for those with UC or similar IBDs, and contains tips and tricks for food
      management/what to avoid, recipes that are safe for people with UC, an interactive map highlighting restaurants
      and stores to shop at, tips for maintaining mental health, and information on websites and forums that I found
      useful. The link to the website can be found <a href="https://ulcerativecolitis.fly.dev/"
        target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      NOTE: In the interest of maintaining academic integrity, I am unable to share the source code for the programs. I
      do have it stored in a private REPO and can make it available to anyone interested as long as it isn’t used to
      submit coursework and doesn’t violate academic standards.

      <li>Wordle Solver: A Simple Wordle Solver Program. See README.md file <a href='./ReadMes/WordleSolver/README.md' target='_blank'>here</a>

      <li>A simple FTP client: See README.md file <a href='./ReadMes/FTP/README.md' target='_blank'>here</a></li>
      <li>Simple BGP router</li>
      <li>Secure Transport over UDP: See README.md file <a href='./ReadMes/UDP/README.md' target='_blank'>here</a></li>
      <li>Multi-threaded web crawler: This implementation crawls website in search of 5 hidden secret flags. My
        implementation uses multi-threading and a relatively straight forward iterative algorithm. Initial recursive
        algorithm didn’t scale; single threaded iterative algorithm was too slow and didn’t meet expected performance
        benchmarks. Conversion to a multi-threaded implementation was relatively straight forward and easily met the
        performance benchmarks. See README.md file <a href='./ReadMes/WebCrawler/README.md' target='_blank'>here</a></li>
      <li>Raft consensus protocol: The requirement was to implement a relatively simple distributed cache/key-value
        datastore (similar to redis, Memcached, DynamoDB, etc.). The implementation used Raft consensus protocol. This
        project was of particular interest to me as I could see the practical application of such a cache in a
        commercial setting. One of our critical applications uses a commercial distributed cache to achieve scalability
        and meet performance requirements. Read more about Raft consensus protocol and browse reference implementations
        at <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank">Raft’s GitHub site</a>. There are also quite a few useful
        YouTube videos explaining the protocol, and challenges faced. This project was one of the more complex
        assignments I had to work on and learned a lot in the process. See README.md file <a href='./ReadMes/DistributedCache/README.md'

    <h3>AI/ML Projects</h3>
    <p>
      As a part of my learning of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I've built a Neural Network from scratch
      in Python that uses the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits 1-9. This includes implementing loss,
      activation functions, forward and back propagation and their necessary math, and loss and accuracy plots. The link
      to the GitHub is provided <a href="https://github.com/Rightafire2/MNISTDigitRecognition" target="_blank">here</a>,
      including the code, data, and explanation of the math.
